Python scripts should be hosted on the Raspberry Pi devices. 
Real World casing would be each client would have a Raspberry Pi device acting as a bridge between the individual sensors and the internet. 
Using a bash script we can start the python script on startup of the bridge device. 
Python script for each client will require a couple lines of code adjusted, as the database variable on line 33 of the main script will need to be the clients code.
